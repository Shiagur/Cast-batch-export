This is a simple script for Blender, which batch exports multiple .cast files.

The Export panel can be found in the 3d view on the left side under "Cast".

It requires the Cast add-on for Blender, which can be found here:

The script was made in Blender version 4.5.4.LTS, but should work with earlier 4.x.x versions.




Installation:




First, you either download the file "__innit__.py" or open it in the repository, select the whole code and copy it to your clipboard.

Next, open your project .blend file and go to the scripting workspace.

In the text window on the right, you either open the downloaded "__innit__.py", or create a new file and paste the copied code into it.

Once the code is in the text window, click the "Run" button.

There should now be a new export panel under the Cast category in the 3d viewport, and you can return to your previous workspace.

If you want the script to execute automatically every time you open the .blend file, you can enable the "Register" checkmark in the "Text" menu of the Text Editor.

Now, the next time you open the .blend file, you'll be greeted with a window that asks you to allow the execution of the script.

BUT BE WARNED: Do NOT check the "Permanently allow execution of scripts". 

Otherwise you leave yourself open to potential malware.
